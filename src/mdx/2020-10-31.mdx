## Project for ...?

5 years ago, back in the university, I was greatly inspired by the film series [Up!](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(film_series)>), which recorded 20 different children from the age of 7 to 56.

Since then, I started to wonder, how about we started it with a group of friends? How different our lives can every 5 years?

It was a mixture of feelings, even as I watched the series again while drafting this blog. Background, parenthood, education, relationship, pursuing careers, racism, politics, and opinions of the future are greatly different from each consecutive recording on the same _kids_. Life has been shaping everyone **unexpectedly**, at the same time **expectedly**.

## Un-expectation

Un-expectation was majorly affected by _opportunities_ and _decision making_. Of course, sometimes he or she did not seem to have any chance to change the situation.

"I'd like to be an astronaut when I grow up or becoming a coach driver because I like traveling." replied a boy at the age of 7 when he was asked about his future career.

Every seven years, he had a different attitude and reasoning towards what life he had then been living for him, and sometimes it did not seem pleasant at all. He had once been homeless, lived in a truck feeling hopeless, but at the age of 56, he found an interest in politics and became a local government member helping and serving the local area.

People rarely know what they really want and what to pursue. Goals have been changed or hammered most of the time. I have to admit that I would have no clue if someone asks me questions like, "What do you **want** to do now or in the future?" or "What do you **want** to achieve in life?"

There is hardly a strong _desire_ to act as a lifelong mission for me, and sometimes I would follow the trend and stop thinking about the reason behind the action. üòï

## Expectation

Life as a kid who went to private school seemed quite expected. With a supporting background and hard work, he successfully graduated from Cambridge and became a lawyer.

From the beginning to the end, he did not seem to worry too much like others, except about his study/careers. He had been surely lived in the more upper-class edge among the participants, and a great advantage with well-prepared education brought his life in the way that more or less under his/everyone else's expectation.

Pain is caused by comparison.

Maybe it was constrained by the limit of time, the TV series did not show much of his pitfalls. His life had been probably the _stablest_ among all. No much drama, but was it really?

I guess nobody can tell, as we are just **comparing** their changes instead of **understanding** their changes.

## Looking forward

> Life is not there to be regretted, it is there to be lived.

Yesterday, _Dan Abramov_ has also twitted [this](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1322140012184543233?s=21) and discussed whether people have free will. I would say yes most of the time, but sometimes no, as people might not have perfect choices to pick from. I kind of treat my life as a composite of many board games like [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge), where the lord or others have played their cards, I would need to figure out how to playback nicely. Winning or losing this turn or even this game does not matter too much, as long as your strategy or plan has been proven effective in the long run.

Or as long as you are happy when playing the games!

## Hold on, what about your project?

Back to the business, I have to say I really miss my old friends back in university, and this is probably another intentional causality I planned 5 years ago. As a shy introvert, even it could become a little awkward or uncomfortable, I really do want to know and care more about them after these long 5 years.

Oh, this is probably also helping me stammer less when speaking in English back then!

I am probably still a Jack in the box, especially getting over-excited mostly by my curiosity towards the unknown. Act now as I can!
