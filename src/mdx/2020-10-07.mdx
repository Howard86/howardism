## Hello World!

This is the very first post from Howard, a tech enthusiast / lifelong learner / bad mathematician.

I have always been thinking about blogging for a long time, yet English is not my mother tongue. This is a place with lots of personal opinions, possibly including lots of rambling and non-sense comments. However, this simply represents the way I have perceived the world, and feel free to share yours!

Since starting programming 6 years ago, especially from a mathematical background, I have been wondering the reason why we write codes, or how we should think about writing codes. Does not quite make sense, right? We **solved** problems, but why should we?

## What are the problems?

There is a 10,000-hour rule that says you would be good at any skill after spending 10,000 hours on it. What if someone can create a program and tell the computer/robot to complete the task your skills can make? Does that mean a 10,000-hour _waste_ of time?

I'm afraid not.

I am a big fan of [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku). People like me enjoy the process of working on problems, even someone else might have invented a solution that is 100 times more brilliant and efficient than mine. Why are we spending time wrapping our heads around? And trying to figure out something that has a solution?

I guess we love solving problems, no matter how trivial or unimportant they are.

## Back to coding...

How should we think about _writing codes_? Possibly to get a moderate income and live happily ever after?

I suppose it gives us the ability to use tools to create tools and help with our problems. It is simply a relatively modern and fancy way in the current world. We can probably achieve the same result when [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com) becomes a thing.

Anyway, I love coding and probably will not stop doing it whatsoever.

It is much easier to figure out what a computer thinks. ðŸ˜„
