# About Algorithm

## Computer Science

### Test

Today, I would like to share my path of learning computer science and programming. With a quick [google search](https://medium.com/techie-delight/top-algorithms-data-structures-concepts-every-computer-science-student-should-know-e0549c67b4ac), some fancy words will pop up, and you might be wondering, "Hmmm, are we back to school again?" Data structures? Programming concepts? What's going on?

## Data Structure

Let's imagine the following, say if you are going to do grocery shopping. If you happen to need a lot of food and other necessities, you might consider stop at Costco with a _car_ and get your 2-week supply easily (especially during this period). If not, you might consider stopping by a local store with a _shopping bag_ and probably getting some snacks.

The difference choice depends on what and **how much** you would like to purchase this time, and maybe how **big** or how **heavy** they could be ended up with. This applies to really similar to our topic - Data Structure, which are simply different sizes of boxes that programmers (like me) can pick to store items. If you are going to save small and simple data (a.k.a. _primitive_), a hand-carry bag with enough size will do for you. However, if you are looking for a nice trunk (or boot) of a car and organizing items in a particular order (remember not to lay cans on top of the egg!), then boxes with more complexity will be your best fit.

Data structures are just boxes, which you probably think about when moving out of your house for the first time!

## Algorithm

The algorithm is the method to achieve the result you want, possibly with the help of data structures! Continuing the example, if we are thinking about getting our 2-week grocery shopping efficiently done, we would like to drive and ship all the goods. Easy peasy. However, you can probably reach the same final result with _10_ shopping bags, saving gasoline and some parking fees.

Sounds a bit silly, huh? We have 2 arms with limited strength, and without a doubt, we would choose the former option even the later one does have some benefits (thinking about body workout?). In terms of computers, there are thousands of ways to achieve the same result, but some are just more efficient to proceed. You and I may not know the best route, but it is important not to pick some less **effective** options. With the help of data structures (car trunk or shopping bags), we can quickly decide and maybe test the one that seems most likely to be more **efficient**, and sometimes it is called the _Best Practice_.

## Learn, learn, learn

As required to program in JavaScript in the company (as production codes), I have not been able to work with data structures or algorithms often due to the nature of this language (I will probably _blog/moan_ about this more next time). However, with more reading on computer science textbooks and trying programming under other frameworks like [Java Spring](https://spring.io/) and [Rust Actix web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web), it becomes clear that I lack this area of practice and real-world experience.

By the way, problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) are also challenging and interesting. It really feels like back to high school to attempt really some hard Maths questions ([STEP](https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/about-step/) in our year), without much knowledge or tools to support answering the questions. If you are interested in programming, feel free to share your thoughts, too!

Oh, for clarity purposes,

`JavaScript IS NOT Java`,

as much as

`Hot Dog IS NOT Dog`.
